# math_special_functions
A C++ libaries depicting some widely used mathematical functions including exponential, sigmoid, etc.

## Current Available Functions
1) Exponential f(x) = e^x
2) Sigmoid f(x) = e^x/(e^x + 1)

## Developer's note
In the sigmoid function file, for all x > 88, ans = 1 is used as normal floating point numbers cannot go through that precision.
