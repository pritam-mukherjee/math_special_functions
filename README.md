# math_special_functions
C++ libaries depicting some widely used mathematical functions including exponential, sigmoid, etc.

## Current Available Functions
1) **Exponential** f(x) = e^x
2) **Sigmoid** f(x) = e^x/(e^x + 1)
3) **Fibonacci** Series Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 | Including limiting ratio of consecutive terms as the __golden ratio__
4) Function for checking if number is **prime**

## Developer's note
-> In the sigmoid function file, for all x > 88, ans = 1 is used as normal floating point numbers cannot go through that precision.

## Liscences
These libraries are open sourced and free to use and re-distribute. No liability of working failure, however, shall be mine as disclaimed now. Re-evaluate before using in mission-critical jobs.
