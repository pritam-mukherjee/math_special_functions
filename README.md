# math_special_functions
A C++ libaries depicting some widely used mathematical functions including exponential, sigmoid, etc.

## Current Available Functions
1) Exponential f(x) = e^x
2) Sigmoid f(x) = e^x/(e^x + 1)
3) Fibonacci Series Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 | Including limiting ratio of consecutive terms as the golden ratio

## Developer's note
-> In the sigmoid function file, for all x > 88, ans = 1 is used as normal floating point numbers cannot go through that precision.
